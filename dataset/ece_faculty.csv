jontalle,Jont Allen," Allens website is (http://auditorymodels.org)  BIO:
During his 32 year AT&T Bell Labs career (after 1998, AT&T Labs) Allen specialized in nonlinear cochlear modeling, auditory and cochlear speech processing, and speech perception. While at AT&T Allen wrote more than 50 sole-authored journal articles on hearing, cochlear modeling, signal processing, room acoustics, speech perception and the articulation index (AI, a.k.a.  speech transmission index (STI), Speech intelligibility index (SII)). In 1982-1987 Allen he had primary responsibility with the development of the first commercial multiband wideband dynamic range compression (WDRC) hearing aid, later sold as the ReSound hearing aid. During this 5 years he was working closely with clinical audiologists and speech and hearing scientists, and with several hearing aid manufactures (Starkey, Phonak, Etymotic), who subsequently funded Allen's work.  During this period Allen wrote the first DSP code and developed the first fitting system, based on loudness in 1/2 octave bands (LGOB) which was used by ReSound as their commercial fitting system for many years. He was also responsible for the first analog compression circuits used in the primary product, that was produced by AT&T for ReSound, at the Allentown PA silicon foundry. Starting in 1986, Allen developed one of the first systems for non-evasively evaluating cochlear hearing using distortion produce otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), known as the (Cub^eDis) measurement system, which for several years (1988-1995) was commercially sold by Etymotic research, and after that by Mimosa Acoustics, for which Allen serves as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). From 1998-2003, while at AT&T Labs, a spin off from Bell Labs, Allen worked on Loudness and consonant perception, which is a problem closely related to AI theory. In Aug. 2003 he join the ECE faculty, University of IL, Urbana where he teaches and works with his students on noninvasive objective diagnostic testing of cochlear and middle ear function, based on  acoustic reflectance (aka impedance) methods of the middle ear, auditory psychophysics, speech processing for hearing aid applications (noise reduction and multiband compression), speech and music coding (bit-rate reduction) and speech perception (models of loudness and  masking) and hearing aid transducer modeling. He is most actively working on the theory and practice of human speech recognition, for both normal and hearing impaired hearing, with the goals of improving hearing aid signal processing as well as automatic speech recognition robustness in the presences of noise and filtering.  From 2003-present, Allen has a number of students active in various projects on speech perception, middle ear models and hearing aid signal processing (Allen's Research Group) In the last 10 years Allen and his students have collected several large databases of speech perception in noise, by normal and impaired human subjects. This work has resulting in many publications on human speech perception.   From 2005-present Allen has also studied reading disabilities in young children. This work has been in collaboration with Prof. Cynthia Johnson of the UIUC Speech and Hearing Science Department (and many of her students). A third major research topic is the diagnosis of middle ear disorders, based on acoustic impedance measurements.This work is well documented in the publications from 1974-2015  (http://auditorymodels.web.engr.illinois.edu//index.php/Main/Publications). Allen has successfully developed several complex and innovative research programs,  first at Bell Labs in 1995  (cochlear modeling), followed by the development of the Bell Labs multiband compression hearing aid (1985-88) (Now labeled as GN-ReSound en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReSound), followed by his speech perception research at UIUC in 2003 with his group of highly productive students.  This research has  provided many deep insights into difficult, significant and challenging problems of speech perception. Specifically Allen and his students have identified the basic features of many plosive and fricative speech sounds. This has allowed them to manipulate the perception of speech with surgical precision. Allen is well-versed in cochlear modeling, auditory neurophysiology, speech perception, speech processing, psychophysics, audiology as well as musical, speech and middle ear acoustics, acoustic impedance and reflectance, analog and digital signal processing, and clinical audiology.  Allen has more than 20 US patents on hearing aids, signal processing and middle ear measurement diagnostics. He teaches courses in mathematical physics (http://auditorymodels.web.engr.illinois.edu/index.php/Courses/ECE493-2013AdvEngMath), speech processing (http://auditorymodels.web.engr.illinois.edu/index.php/Courses/ECE537-2014SpeechProcessing), analog and digital signal processing, and clinical audiology, electroacoustics, transducer design (http://auditorymodels.web.engr.illinois.edu/index.php/Courses/ECE403-2013AudioEngineering).  His special interest is speech perception, which brings together many of these fields in a relevant way.  Additionally Allen has co-taught ECE-545 (Advanced Physical Acoustics) (https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/2013/fall/ECE/545). This coming semester he has introduced a new math course for undergraduates ""ECE 298 JA - Concepts in Engineering Math"" (http://www.ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE298JA-120158, http://auditorymodels.web.engr.illinois.edu/index.php/Courses/ECE298JA-F15). Since the early 1990's, Allen has been a visiting scientist in the Departments of Otolaryngology of Columbia University, City university of New York, and University of Calgary, and was an Osher Fellow at the Exploratorium Museum, San Francisco (www.exploratorium.edu/). He has been very active in IEEE and the ASA, running both major conferences (IEEE-ICASSP 1985, New York) and many small workshops.","

He was an IBM and Link Foundation PhD fellow and the recipient of Boeing Engineering and Dow Sustainability Innovation awards. Semiconductor fundamentals are essential in understanding everyday electronic and photonic devices. Undergraduate education should provide a solid foundation in semiconductors and should relate to everyday solid state devices. My goal as an instructor is to get students explain device behavior from the atomic scale up. I achieve this via first motivating the class for the big picture and then focusing on the atomic scale and describing atomic interactions leading to macroscopic effects observed in solid state devices. By building up the device behavior through atomic engineering, students understand the fundamentals governing everyday semiconductor devices such as light emitting diodes, solar cells, and transistors. It is notable that underlying physics, engineering, and science of solid state devices remain the same half a century; however, their applications  which I deem most important as an engineering faculty  diverse speedily. I see my role as a faculty not only to teach the fundamentals to the students but also making them aware of many out-there opportunities in the world. In the midst of fast-paced technology, one way to enable this is updating teaching tools and course materials. My instruction is geared towards enabling students become aware that microelectronics and photonics field is beyond the conventional solid state device applications and exciting them into the emerging interdisciplinary areas. I firmly believe teaching and research go hand-in-hand. I bring real-life problems to the classroom. Students need to leave their comfort zone, forego the classical classroom mentality, and look at tomorrow's needs via extending their knowledge, skills, and self. I bring fundamental knowledge, updated tools, and targeted means to the classroom for them do so. Our current research interests lie in the intersection of novel III-V materials and hetero-structures & photonic and electronic quantum devices. Particularly, we explore novel materials, devices, and their 3D hetero-integration on unconventional platforms such as graphene and silicon, heat transport across/through semiconductors, efficiency droop mechanisms and remedies in AlInGaN emitters, and ultra-fast THz photonics/electronics. Our work is interdisciplinary. Our team demonstrates strong skills in solid state physics, first principles calculations, Technology Computer Aided Design, micro/nano-fabrication, and reliability characterization and analysis of semiconductor devices. Our group might have an opening for a postdoctoral researcher who has HANDS-ON experience in the micro/nano-FABRICATION of compound semiconductor devices (including light emitting diodes and transistors based on GALLIUM NITRIDE devices) in a cleanroom environment. Postdoctoral candidates are encouraged to contact Prof. Can Bayram directly via email (and should attach their CV and the contact information for at least two references) to inquire about any position/project openings. Our group is inviting undergraduate and graduate students to apply for PhD thesis openings in the areas of (a) Novel III-V materials and hetero-structures, and (b) Photonic and electronic quantum devices.

jbernhar, Jennifer Bernhard," Prof. Bernhard's research addresses applications-oriented electromagnetic problems with an emphasis on theoretical analysis and experimental investigation. Her research group focuses on two areas: Electromagnetics for Wireless Communication and Reconfigurable Active and Passive Antennas.   Electromagnetics for Wireless Communication: This work centers on cutting-edge technology development and design techniques that will enable high data-rate wireless communication and wireless parallel computation. Prof. Bernhard's research group investigates the effects of packaging on antenna performance and uses these results to develop design-oriented models for internal antennas, embedded antennas, and diversity schemes. The research also creates synthesis approaches for internal portable antenna systems, including IoT, that produce desired performance while reducing user exposure and battery usage.    Reconfigurable Active and Passive Antennas: Prof. Bernhard's research implements reconfigurability in antenna structures to provide flexibility in operating frequency, bandwidth, and radiation pattern performance. Reconfigurability is accomplished using MEMS (microelectromechanical system) or traditional microwave switches, ferroelectric materials, or mechanical actuation of antenna components. The new multi-function antennas developed in this research will reduce dramatically the number and size of large array-based antenna systems, improve system efficiency, and decrease system cost and weight.    The research group is supported by a specialized fabrication facility, a new anechoic chamber (the Illinois Wireless Wind Tunnel), Agilent vector network analyzers, and opportunities for collaborations with the UIUC Center for Computational Electromagnetics.   Students with an interest in applied electromagnetics, including antennas and high frequency circuits, are encouraged to contact me via e-mail.  The background required for an undergraduate research position in my lab includes good performance in ECE 329 and ECE 450, with other advanced EM courses always a plus.  For first- and second-year students who haven't taken these courses yet, opportunities may exist from semester to semester to help with the research projects of advanced undergraduates or graduate students, but at a more basic level.","

boppart,Stephen Allen Boppart,"Prof. Boppart graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 1990 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and an option in Bioengineering. Continuing at UIUC, he completed his M.S. in Electrical Engineering in 1991, where he developed microfabricated multi-electrode arrays for neural recordings. From 1991 to 1993, at the Air Force Laser Laboratory in San Antonio, Texas, he conducted research on laser-tissue interactions in the eye, helping establish national laser safety standards. Prof. Boppart then went on to MIT, receiving his Ph.D. in 1998 in Medical and Electrical Engineering. His doctoral studies included the development of optical coherence tomography in Prof. Jim Fujimoto's laboratory.  As part of a joint program between MIT and Harvard, Prof. Boppart completed his M.D. from Harvard Medical School in June 2000. Currently, Prof. Boppart is an Abel Bliss Professor of Engineering with appointments in the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Bioengineering, and Medicine at UIUC. He is Head of the Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology and along with a team of 25 researchers, is investigating novel optical diagnostic imaging technologies for basic science and translational clinical applications.  From 2006-2008, he served as Founding Director of the Mills Breast Cancer Institute, and holds a research position with Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, Illinois. His efforts included constructing a new building and developing new infrastructure to support translational research and technology development in biomedical research between UIUC and Carle Foundation Hospital.  Prof. Boppart has co-founded three companies, the two more recent at UIUC include Diagnostics Photonics and PhotoniCare, which include novel optical imaging technologies for surgical and primary care applications, respectively. Currently he is Director of the campus-wide Imaging at Illinois initiative which leverages the strengths and diversity of over 100 faculty working in all aspects of imaging science, technology, and applications. Prof. Boppart's teaching activities and interests are highly interdisciplinary, following his research activities. Teaching activities cover cross-cutting areas in engineering, medicine, and biology. Courses have included ECE/BioE 414 and 415, Biomedical Instrumentation lecture and laboratory, ECE 460 Optical Imaging, ECE 380 Biomedical Imaging, and ECE 467 Biophotonics. For each of these, courses are taught relating fundamental engineering and scientific principles to real-world applications. Students participate directly with state-of-the-art information exchange by performing literature searches and preparing classroom presentations of journal articles about techniques and technologies discuss in lecture. Concepts are reinforced by use of stimulating discussions centered around clinical scenarios. For example, students in ECE 380 Biomedical Imaging are randomly given a medical beeper than when called for an ""emergency"", are presented with clinical medical images and scenarios that call on their ability to apply course principles to diagnose technical problems in the imaging data or systems. Students complete these courses having a broad-based knowledge of these subjects, and key tools for further in-depth investigations and advanced study. My interdisciplinary research group combines the fields of engineering, medicine, and biology to develop novel optical biomedical imaging technologies and translate these for biological discovery and clinical applications. Biophotonics, the application of light in medicine, biology, and biotechnology applications, enables us to develop innovative technologies to detect disease at early stages, when it is most amenable to treatment. There is a long history of undergraduate research opportunities in Prof. Boppart's Biophotonics Imaging Laboratory. Over the last 15 years, over 75 undergraduate students have conducted research in Prof. Bopparts laboratory, often leading to an undergraduate thesis. Research areas cover aspects of optical imaging and physics, signal and imaging processing, image acquisition systems, biomedical optics and biophotonics, laser and optical source development, and clinical imaging applications. Undergraduate research experiences typically extend over two or more semesters, and result in the completion of an undergraduate thesis and a departmental symposium presentation. Exceptional research has been published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national conferences.","

(cum laude) and M.Sc. degrees from the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, in 1974 and 1981 respectively, and the Ph.D degree from Stanford University, in 1986, all in Electrical Engineering.  In 1987 he joined the  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he is  currently a GEBI Founder Professor of Engineering at the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and of Bioengineering, and professor at the Coordinated Science Laboratory.   He is also President and Chief Technology Ocer at InstaRecon, Inc., a startup he founded to commercialize breakthrough technology for tomographic reconstruction developed in his academic research.  His current  research interests include multi-dimensional and statistical signal processing and their applications to inverse problems in imaging, and in particular compressed sensing and computed tomography, and machine learning in signal processing.   Dr. Bresler has served on the editorial board of several journals, including the IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, the IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Signal Processing, Machine Vision and Applications, and the SIAM Journal on Imaging Science. He has also served on various committees of the IEEE, including the Image and Multidimensional Signal Processing Technical Committee, Biomaging and Signal Processing Technical Committee, and the Awards Board of the IEEE Signal Processing Society.    Dr. Bresler  received two Best Journal Paper Awards from the IEEE Signal Processing society, and two paper he coauthored with his students received the Young Author Best Paper Award from the same society in 2002 and in 2016.  He is the recipient of a 1991 NSF Presidential Young Investigator  Award, the Technion (Israel Inst. of Technology) Fellowship in 1995, and the Xerox Senior Award for Faculty Research in 1998. He was named a University of Illinois Scholar in 1999, appointed as an Associate at the Center for Advanced Study of the University in 2001-2, and Faculty Fellow at the National Cener for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) in 2006. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and of the American Institute for Medical and Biomedical Engineers (AIMBE).  My teaching focuses on signal processing at both the undergraduate and graduate level. I regularly teach ECE310 -- introduction to DSP, ECE311 - Intro to DSP Lab,  and ECE 513 -- Vector Space Signal Processing. My current research addresses five main areas: 1) Practical Compressive Sensing. This work addresses the development of theory and methods for sampling signals at less than the Nyquist rate, by using sparsity properties of their representation with respect to an appropriate basis, or in an appropriate space. Applications are being developed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and in computed tomography (CT). 2)Statistical and Machine Learning for Sparse Signal Representation and Compressive Sensing. New methods of learning efficient signal representations from data are being developed and applied to compressive sensing. Learning the models from the sensed data itself provides substantial reduction in the amount of data needed for high-quality reconstruction. The application to Big Data is a recent area of emphasis in this work, which now addresses the development of scalable and on-line algorithms. 3) Statistical and Machine Learning (including deep neural networks) for inverse problems in imaging. 4) Study of fundamental performance bounds and the development of computationally efficient algorithms with provable guaranteed performance for bilinear inverse problems with sparsity constraints. These problems are more difficult than linear inverse problems, and much less is known about their theory. Yet, they arise in many engineering and scientific applications, including the classical problem of blind deconvolution. 5) Signal processing for Big Data, and in particular for mutlidimensional (tensor) data, with applications in brain imaging and neuroscience.","

choquett,Kent D Choquette,"Kent D. Choquette received B.S. degrees in Engineering Physics and Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado-Boulder and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Materials Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  From 1990 to 1992 he held a postdoctoral appointment at AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ. He then joined Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM, and from 1993 to 2000 was a Principal Member of Technical Staff.  While at Sandia in 1994 he invented and demonstrated the first monolithic selectively oxidized vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) which today is referred to as the oxide-confined VCSEL, which toay is manufactured around the world and over a billion have been deployed in data communication and sensing applications. He became a Professor in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois in 2000.  His Photonic Device Research Group is centered around the design, fabrication, characterization, and applications of vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), photonic crystal light sources, nanofabrication technologies, and hybrid integration techniques for photonic devices.  Dr. Choquette has authored over 300 technical publications and three book chapters, and has presented numerous invited talks and tutorials.  He is an Associate Editor of the Journal of Lightwave Technology, and served in the past as Associate Editor of IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, and IEEE Photonic Technology Letters, and as a Guest Editor of IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics.  From 2000 to 2002, he was an IEEE/Lasers and Electro-Optics Society (LEOS) Distinguished Lecturer.  He was awarded the 2008 IEEE/Photonics Society Engineering Achievement Award, the 2012 Nick Holonyak, Jr. Award from the Optical Society of America, the 2013 Distinguished Service Award from the IEEE Photonics Society, and the 2016 Technology Achievement Award from SPIE. He has served as the IEEE Photonics Society Vice President of Conferences, Vice President of Technical Affairs, President Elect, and in 2016-2017 he will serve as the President. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, a Fellow of the Optical Society of America, a Fellow of SPIE, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The among the reasons that I joined the University of Illinois, after spending 10 years at Bell Laboratories and Sandia National Laboratories, is the opportunity to teach the next generation of scientists and engineers, and the personal challenge and freedom to learn new areas of science and technology.  I teach undergraduate courses covering the physics and fabrication of solid state devices.  In particular, I teach a new introduction course on photonics and its applications in digital information distribution (ECE304), as well as a hands-on photonics lab where students can work with and learn about gas, semiconductor, and fiber lasers (ECE495).  I also teach three graduate courses, an introduction to compound semiconductors and semiconductor lasers (ECE532); a graduate course which I created that covers quantum optoelectronics and microcavity lasers, where students learn applied quantum mechanics and quantum optics (ECE572); and a graduate course which I created that covers the interaction of light with matter on the nanoscale (ECE574). The Photonic device research group is involved in the study of semiconductor photonic and optoelectronic device physics, fabrication technologies, and systems with a strong emphasis on vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). Photonic devices are key components for the infrastructure of the Information Age. Active devices, such as VCSELs, are the foundation for short and soon medium length optical fiber based interconnect applications. Currently there are research efforts to develop new VCSEL devices, such as composite resonator VCSELs and vertical cavity photonic integrated circuits, as well as to establish new VCSEL applications, such as 2-dimensional source and receiver arrays for high aggregate rate interconnects.  Group research into new compound semiconductor processing technologies, such as selective oxidation and heterogeneous integration techniques is also pursued. Finally, the next generation of photonic devices, such as photonic crystal membrane lasers, waveguides and nanocavities, which will enable the next generation of quantum optic communication networks, as well as opto-fluidic microsystems for lab-on-the-chip sensing and health care are under under study.

bcunning,Brian T Cunningham,"  My research group is focused on the application of sub-wavelength optical phenomena and fabrication methods to the development of novel devices and instrumentation for the life sciences.   The group is highly interdisciplinary, with expertise in the areas of microfabrication, nanotechnology, computer simulation, instrumentation, molecular biology, and cell biology.  In particular, we are working on biosensors based upon photonic crystal concepts that can either be built from low-cost flexible plastic materials, or integrated with semiconductor-based active devices, such as light sources and photodetectors, for high performance integrated detection systems.    Using a combination of micrometer-scale and nanometer-scale fabrication tools, we are devising novel methods and materials for producing electro-optic devices with nanometer-scale features that can be scaled for low-cost manufacturing.  Many of our techniques are geared for compatibility with flexible plastic materials, leading to applications such as low cost disposable sensors, wearable sensors, flexible electronics, and flexible displays. Because our structures manipulate light at a scale that is smaller than an optical wavelength, we rely on computer simulation tools such as Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis (RCWA) and Finite Difference Time Doman (FDTD) to model, design, and understand optical phenomena within photonic crystals and related devices.   In addition to fabricating devices, our group is also focused on the design, prototyping, and testing of biosensor instrumentation for high sensitivity, portability, and resolution.  Advanced instruments enable high resolution imaging of biochemical and cellular interactions with the ability to monitor images of biochemical interactions as a function of time. Using the sensors and instrumentation, we are exploring new applications for optical biosensor technology including protein microarrays, biosensor/mass spectrometry systems, and microfluidics-based assays using nanoliter quantities of reagents.  The methods and systems developed in the laboratory are applied in the fields of life science research, drug discovery, diagnostic testing, and environmental monitoring.","

jdallesa,John Michael Dallesasse,"Prof. Dallesasse has over 20 years of experience in the Optoelectronics Industry, and has held a wide range of positions in technology development and management, including Vice President of MicroLink Devices and Senior Director of Engineering and Technology for Emcores Fiber Optics Division.  Most recently, he was the Chief Technology Officer, Vice President, and co-founder of Skorpios Technologies, Inc., a venture-capital funded startup that is developing and commercializing silicon photonic ICs based upon a wafer-scale process for selective integration of III-V materials on SOI substrates.  His technical contributions include, with Nick Holonyak, Jr., the discovery of III V Oxidation, which has become an important process technology in the fabrication of high-speed VCSELs.  Prof. Dallesasse has also been an active participant in the IEEE 802.3 standards effort, and was an important contributor in the definition of the 10GBASE-LX4 port type for use with installed legacy multimode fiber. A key attraction of making the transition from a successful career in industry to an academic position is the ability to pass on years of accumulated experience to a new generation.  Through the course of my career I have had the ability to mentor many young engineers, helping them grow both personally and professionally.  This has been one of my greatest sources of satisfaction, and a key motivation for my career growth into engineering management.  There is tremendous satisfaction in seeing a spark of insight turn into a flame of knowledge.  Making a positive impact on the lives of others through helping them learn and then seeing the contributions that they, in turn, are able to make provides a fulfillment that cannot be measured. Photonic integration is a necessity for next-generation optical networks.  As the number of applications that demand significant bandwidth increase, the ability of existing networks to serve those needs is compromised.  Solutions that enable the existing fiber infrastructure to carry more data, such as advanced optical modulation formats based upon phase-shift-keying and polarization multiplexing, require complex optical transmitters and coherent optical receivers assembled using discrete components.  These solutions are too expensive for broad deployment, and face fundamental challenges in reducing system cost.  The most promising approach to overcoming these challenges is photonic integration.  Both Silicon Photonics and Monolithic Integration on InP face fundamental challenges.  Silicon is an outstanding material for complex electronics and waveguides, but its indirect bandgap and weak nonlinear optical properties create challenges with regard to the generation, efficient detection, and active control of light.  Compound semiconductor materials, especially those that are lattice matched to InP or GaAs, are outstanding materials for these functions but are costly and not ideal for the fabrication of complex electronics, especially ICs such as network processors.  Past attempts to bring these materials together have not progressed past the R&D stage due to limitations in performance, reliability, or manufacturability.  Direct epitaxial growth of GaAs or InP on silicon faces the problem of having a high defect-density metamorphic layer that can impact device reliability.  Wafer bonding techniques, which have been successfully employed in the LED area as well as in the fabrication of SOI wafers, show promise but also face challenges.  Direct bonding at high temperature creates significant stress, as the thermal expansion coefficients of Si and III-Vs are not well matched.  This stress has an unacceptable impact on device reliability.  Lower-temperature bonding techniques using plasma activation, chemical treatment, or atomically thin interface layers show promise but require further development.  An integration approach that recognizes and addresses material compatibility issues and manufacturability should be able to overcome prior barriers to commercialization and enable broad deployment of photonic integrated circuits.  What to integrate is also a key area of interest.  Recent progress on the Feng-Holonyak Transistor Laser suggests that it may be able to serve as a fundamental device element in photonic-electronic integrated circuits, but further research on device integration is required. The Advanced Semiconductor Device and Integration Group welcomes the participation of undergraduates in the research process through independent study projects, undergraduate thesis projects, and through information working relationships.  A limited number of slots are available, but interested individuals are encouraged to contact Professor Dallesasse or one of his graduate students.","

p-dragic,Peter D Dragic,"Optical fibers are ubiquitous, finding wide-reaching applications that enable the modern world.  Most importantly, their remarkably low loss has facilitated long-distance telecommunications. Indeed, in late 2017, Corning (as but one of a few large fiber manufacturers) celebrated the delivery of its 1 billionth kilometer of optical fiber, nearly the distance from the Earth to Saturn. Every cell phone conversation or text message propagates along a fiber at some point in its journey. Optical fibers are doped with additives making them attractive active gain media for high power lasers, a market (fiber-based lasers, or fiber lasers) expected to surpass $4 billion by 2025. They are used in imaging systems as endoscopes and as laser power delivery conduits for dental and medical procedures. They are used as the active sensors in sensing systems, enabling the remote and distributed measurement of undersea weather, structural health, and temperature, to name just a few.   Fibers performance, however, has reached a sort of plateau, with limitations typically deriving from a bouquet of deleterious nonlinear light-matter interactions between the lightwave and the glass. These usually take the form of a maximum allowable optical power (or rather intensity), either that can be propagated through or produced from an optical fiber. This has inspired a new thrust in specialty fiber design that is largely rooted in conventional wave propagation methodologies. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these waveguide designs offer only incremental improvements to the systems utilizing them since they only enable very slight increases in the maximum allowable power. Consider, for instance, a Poisson-dominated, shot-noise-limited sensing system based on a fiber laser, operating at, or near to, its nonlinearity-restricted upper power limit. Should there be a requirement of a 10 dB enhancement in system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), this would then require a 20 dB (or 100) increase in laser power/pulse energy to be realized. Such technological leaps are not possible with the current state-of-the art in waveguide design. My research and design methodology of optical fibers relies heavily on a highly interdisciplinary approach that marries waveguide engineering and materials science. We owe many of the amazing capabilities of optical fiber to the pioneering work of materials scientists, whose efforts resulted in the mass-production of the low-loss optical fibers which connect our modern world.  Soon after the development of the first low loss fiber in the 1970s, waveguide designers were inspired to develop a wide range of fiber structures that enhance the capabilities of fiber-based systems. Well-known examples include dispersion shifted and tailored fibers, polarization maintaining fibers, and holey (or micro- and nano-structured) fibers, to name a few.  As such, optical waveguide design (predominantly utilizing silica as the material medium) has traditionally driven most, but not all, advancement in the field of optical fiber technology, with the materials science aspects becoming largely relegated to small niche applications. Today, this practice continues, and hence fiber and fiber laser development now advances only incrementally. It is precisely this apparent technological stagnation that has inspired my team and I to recognize that materials science can help solve many of the challenges and limitations which waveguide design alone could not. Once we recognized that the aforementioned deleterious phenomena in optical fiber systems relate to a controllable material constant or coefficient, many of which can take on zero- or near-zero-values, it became clear that the performance limiters can be removed simply by prohibiting the unwanted interaction from ever taking place.  In short, we have learned how to design these materials systems to achieve optical performance never before seen from optical fibers. This is accomplished through the zeroing or minimization of the material constants that drive the unwanted deleterious processes. Our current research brings materials science back into the mainstream of fiber design by engineering fibers that that have the potential for disruptive influence. Only by coupling materials science and engineering with electromagnetics will optical fiber capabilities sharply improve in the next decade. This will enable the incredible potential of optical fiber based systems, some of which I am actively pursuing: spectroscopic and coherent lidar systems, high power fiber laser technologies, and communications systems.  Our work has also led to designer fibers with unique thermo-mechanical responses that give rise to new distributed sensing architectures. It is important to note that our work also extends other material systems, including crystalline, for next generation applications that rely heavily on these nonlinear processes, such as integrated optical and photonic circuits. The emerging technological renaissance in fibers systems is manifested in my publications and patents.   Three specific examples of current multidisciplinary projects include: 1)	Hypersonic acoustic wave engineering of glass optical fiber 2)	Bridging a gap between next generation laser sources and active sensing systems such as LIDAR 3)	Designing glasses and optical materials for novel optical fiber and waveguide applications including distributed sensing",,"

lgoddard,Lynford L Goddard,"In fall 2019, I plan to teach, ECE 446, ""Principles of Experimental Research in Electrical Engineering"". In spring 2020, I plan to teach, ECE 536, ""Integrated Optics and Optoelectronics"" and/or ECE 329, ""Fields and Waves I"". My research group, the Photonic Systems Laboratory, studies the ways that light, and lasers in particular, can be used for sensing and measurement, communications, and data processing. The research focuses on fabricating, characterizing, and modeling individual lasers and photodetectors, photonics-based sensors, instrumentation, and integrated circuits, as well as developing new processing, inspection, and characterization techniques, and testing novel semiconductor materials and devices. Applications include hydrogen detection for fuel cells, carbon dioxide detection for reducing post harvest food loss, optical spectrum analysis and quantitative phase microscopy for metrology, integrated microring Bragg reflectors for narrow linewidth lasers and next generation chip-scale communication systems, and optical logic, memory and switches for high speed data processing. 1. The Photonic Systems Laboratory is accepting applications for undergraduate students interested in completing a senior research thesis in AY 2018-2019. The student must have a solid academic record and be self motivated, eager to test out new measurement or simulation techniques, and able to commit the time and effort during the academic year necessary to complete the thesis (usually >10 hours per week). Programming skills in LabVIEW or Matlab, or prior research experience or coursework in Optics would be a definite plus. Interested applicants should email an updated resume to Professor Goddard. 2. The group is also looking for an undergraduate student (at any grade level) who has taken ECE 444 to develop processing recipes for microring fabrication in MNTL. The student would also assist with photolithography, etching, and measuring the optical loss of the resulting devices.","

l-haken,Lippold Haken,"In Computer Music, I would like students to get an appreciation for computer music and its technology.  Since musicians and engineers live in quite different worlds, I would like engineering students to learn what it means to do ""serious"" interdisciplinary work with sound designers and musicians. In undergraduate teaching, I feel it is important to nurture ECE student pride in their ability to design and build working devices.  It is important for students to have enough time to implement their own ideas; it is good experience for students to learn how to select chips, how to design PCBs, how to design and debug software and dsp algorithms, how to work with the machine shop, etc.  Both guided learning in structured courses as well as independent project experience are important for our undergraduates. I encourage undergraduates that would like to do research towards designing and implementing devices to look into ECE395.  The primary goal of ECE395 is to build the device; you decide on all hardware components, PCB layout, software programming, motor control or any mechanical aspects you may have, etc.  If you develop novel algorithms or techniques you may optionally present your results at the Undergraduate Research Symposium, and optionally show your work at Engineering Open House.","

jhasegaw, Mark Hasegawa-Johnson,"Mark Hasegawa-Johnson has been on the faculty at the University of Illinois since 1999, where he is currently a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He received his Ph.D. in 1996 at MIT, with a thesis titled ""Formant and Burst Spectral Measures with Quantitative Error Models for Speech Sound Classification,"" after which he was a post-doc at UCLA from 1996-1999. Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, and a Senior Member of IEEE and ACM. He is currently Treasurer of ISCA, and Senior Area Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language. He has published 280 peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers in the general area of automatic speech analysis, including machine learning models of articulatory and acoustic phonetics, prosody, dysarthria, non-speech acoustic events, audio source separation, and under-resourced languages. Professor Hasegawa-Johnson typically teaches Artificial Intelligence (CS 440/ECE 448), Multimedia Signal Processing (ECE 417), and Speech and Image Analysis (ECE 401). He has also taughtSpeech Processing (ECE 537), Digital Signal Processing (ECE 551), Audio Engineering (ECE 403), Pattern Recognition (ECE 544NA), and Probability (ECE 313). Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's research is focused on the area of automatic speech recognition, with a particular focus on the mathematization of linguistic concepts. In the past five years, Dr. Hasegawa-Johnson's group has developed mathematical models of concepts from linguistics including a rudimentary model of pre-conscious speech perception (the landmark-based speech recognizer), a model that interprets pronunciation variability by figuring out how the talker planned his or her speech movements (tracking of tract variables from acoustics, and of gestures from tract variables), and a model that uses the stress and rhythm of natural language (prosody) to disambiguate confusable sentences. Recent application successes include: * Speech recognition for talkers with cerebral palsy.  The automatic system, suitably constrained, outperforms a human listener. * Retrieval of broadcast television segments in four languages, based on queries specified in the international phonetic alphabet.  The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took third place in this international competition, and was the only finalist from the United States. * Automatic detection and labeling of non-speech audio events.  The Illinois team, including students of Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson and Prof. Huang, took first place in this international competition. * Teaching Chinese.  Software and methods developed by Prof. Hasegawa-Johnson, together with his colleagues from Linguistics and Psychology, are being tested in Mandarin language classrooms at the University of Illinois. Professor Hasegawa-Johnson typically supervises one or two undergraduate research projects per year, thesis research preferred.  Past student theses include automatic recognition of musical genre, factorial HMMs for the automatic recognition of speech in music backgrounds, prosody-dependent speech recognition, image source modeling of room impulse response, sonorancy classification for automatic language ID, phonetic landmark detection for automatic language ID, and digital field recorder for acquisition of a natural audio database.","

lyding,Joseph W Lyding,"After being recruited to Illinois in 1984 by John Bardeen to work on the 1D charge density wave problem Professor Lyding constructed the first atomic resolution scanning tunneling mi-croscope (STM) in the Midwestern United States and one of the earliest STMs in the US. He followed this by inventing an ultra-stable STM in 1987 that was patented (US Patent 4,841,148) and licensed by the University of Illinois to RHK and McAllister Technical Services. Lydings design has been copied worldwide and has also been included in major textbooks on surface science. In 1994 Professor Lyding developed a novel new STM-based nanofabrication scheme and achieved atomic resolution patterning of silicon surfaces through the selective desorption of hydrogen. This method was immediately recognized and copied worldwide with Lyding giving scores of invited and several plenary talks. His initial paper on the subject [Appl. Phys. Lett. 64, 2010 (1994)] has been cited 487 times. Lydings initial work uncovered the fact that there were two distinct physical phenomena associated the hydrogen desorption process. This led to collaboration with Dr. Phaedon Avouris at IBM who modeled these processes. Lyding was recognized with an IBM Partnership Award in 1996 which led to a further study of the desorption process with a cryogenic ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) STM constructed in Lydings lab. [Physical Review Letters [80, 1336 (1998), cited 221 times] and the development of feedback controlled lithography for single atom precision hydrogen desorption [Nanotechnology 11, 70 (2000), cited 208 times]. In 1995 Lyding discovered a giant isotope effect when hydrogen was replaced by deuterium on silicon surfaces, in an experiment suggested by Avouris. STM desorption studies showed that deuterium was two orders of magnitude more difficult to desorb than hydrogen. This was published in Chemical Physical Letters [257, 148 (1996)] and Surface Science [363, 368 (1996)] with 157 and 172 citations respectively. In a meeting with Professor Karl Hess, Lyding made the connection between the isotope effect he had observed in the STM experiments and the hydrogen-related hot-carrier degradation in CMOS transistors. Lyding proposed replacing hydrogen with deuterium in CMOS to see if the same isotope effect could reduce the degradation. Lyding and Hess worked with Dr. Isik Kizilyalli of Lucent to treat commercial CMOS chips in deuterium and their initial results showed a dramatic 50x reduction in hot-carrier degradation. Their first paper [Lyding, Hess and Kizilyalli, Appl. Phys. Lett. 68, 2526 (1996)] has been cited 367 times. This result was met with major publicity and was rapidly confirmed by industrial laboratories worldwide. Deuterium has been used in commercial production by several major chip manufacturers, most recently by Samsung, under license from the University of Illinois, for the ARM processors used in iPhone and iPad devices. In 1996 Lyding was called to Washington D.C. by Senator Bill Frist to present the deuterium result to a Senate conference forum on science and technology, exploring the unanticipated technology benefits of supporting fundamental research. In 2001-2002 Lyding began exploring carbon nanotubes on silicon as a potential hybrid approach to using nanotubes. Unfortunately, at that time there was no technique to integrate carbon nanotubes with clean, air sensitive surfaces. STM studies up until then relied on solution deposition of nanotubes onto inert gold surfaces. To circumvent this problem, Lyding developed a new method that he termed dry contact transfer (DCT) [Appl. Phys. Lett. 83, 5029 (2003), cited 84 times] in which nanotubes could be brought into a UHV environment and then directly stamped onto atomically clean surfaces. Lydings group published a number of papers between 2003 and 2007 using DCT to place nanotubes on silicon and III-V compound semiconductor surfaces. In these papers they noted a strong interaction between nanotube and substrate based on the relative alignment of the nanotube axis and substrate atomic row directions. Strong doping effects and nanotube bandgap changes were also observed, underscoring the detailed complexity of potential technological applications of carbon nanotubes. In 2007 Lyding extended the DCT method to the study of monolayer graphene on silicon and III-V substrates. His first paper on graphene [Nanotechnology 19, 015704 (2008)] was recognized as one of the most accessed papers in Nanotechnology for 2008. Unlike nanotubes, finite sheets of graphene have edges and it was predicted in 1996 that edges with the so called zigzag symmetry would exhibit a metallic edge state that should have a pronounced effect on transport through graphene quantum dots or nanoribbons. However, experiments didnt see this effect leading to postulation in the literature that nonuniformity and edge disorder were obfuscating the observation of edge effects. Through DCT of graphene on silicon Lyding and graduate student Kyle Ritter demonstrated for the first time the existence of the metallic zigzag edge state. Furthermore, they studied quantum size effects down to 2nm lateral graphene dimensions, an order of magnitude smaller than previous studies. This work was published in Nature Materials [8, 235 (2009), cited 505 times]. Lydings most recent work on graphene has demonstrated the admixture of graphene and substrate electron wavefunctions [Nano Lett. 10, 3446 (2010)], silicon-induced metallic states in semiconducting graphene quantum dots [Nano Lett. 11, 2735 (2011)], and that the copper (111) surface is the optimal copper surface for monolayer graphene growth [Nano Lett. 11, 4547 (2011), cited 156 times]. In 2006 Lyding invented a novel process for sharpening conductive probes down to sub-5nm radii. His method, Field-Directed Sputter Sharpening (FDSS), is based on ion sputtering of a biased probe. The probe bias establishes an inhomogeneous electric field at the tip apex that deflects the incoming ions and selectively sharpens the apex, which increases the field strength and enhances the effect. High performance STM and AFM tips with super hard coatings have now been demonstrated and Lyding is now the Chief Technical Officer of Tiptek, LLC, a new start-up company to commercialize this technology. The US Patent Office has issued FDSS patents (8,070,920 and 8,819,861). I have developed a new permanent course ECE 481 - Nanotechnology, which I offer every Spring semester. This course is offered with 3 hours credit for advanced undergraduate students and 4 hours of credit for graduate students. I also teach ECE 444 in which students fabricate silicon ICs in a unique laboratory facility. Carbon nanoelectronics, based on carbon nanotubes and graphene are being actively researched for future semiconducting device applications. To this end it is imperative to understand their interactions with technological substrates at the atomistic level. We have developed ultra-clean nanotube deposition and STM spectroscopic methodologies that achieve this level of understanding. Subtle effects are being seen for the first time and are being modeled with first principles theory and simulations.  Our group regularly involves undergraduate researchers in nanotechnology projects aimed at gaining an atomic level understanding of important phenomena that govern the development of nanoelectronic devices. Current projects involve the use of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study carbon nanotubes, graphene and bonded silicon wafers. We are also involved in controlling the growth of carbon nanotubes.","

He has received several awards for his research and teaching, including the 2011 Mac Van Valkenburg Early Career Teaching Award from the IEEE Education Society and the 2008 Zeldovich Medal form the international Committee on Space Research and Russian Academy of Sciences. Prof. Makela's research interests lie in multi-technique remote sensing of the Earth's upper atmosphere. He works with ground- and satellite-based instrumentation to study both the quiet-time and storm-time behavior of this region at low- and mid-latitudes. To accomplish this, his group develops, tests, and deploys suites of sensors to sites around the world.  These instruments include portable imaging systems, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, and Fabry-Perot interferometers.  His research group is currently working on developing new techniques and algorithms to simultaneously analyze these multiple datasets to better understand the underlying electrodynamics of instability processes in the equatorial and mid-latitude ionosphere, as well as the physics coupling of the neutral atmosphere to the electrified plasma in the ionosphere.  They are also developing algorithms that will be used by NASA's Ionospheric Connection Explorer mission, which will study the upward coupling between the atmosphere and near-space environment. His groups work has implications for improving specification and forecasting of space weather, natural hazards warnings, improving distributed sensing techniques, and furthering our understanding of basic space plasma physics.","

Professor Oelze's research deals with several aspects of ultrasound/tissue interaction including: cancer detection using quantitative ultrasound, ultrasound microscopy, bioeffects of ultrasound, ultrasound-based therapies and coded excitation. Professor Oelze is using quantitative ultrasound techniques to analyze ultrasonic backscatter for breast cancer and thyroid cancer detection and for detection and grading of fatty liver disease.  Professor Oelze has examined the effects of ultrasound on hemorrhaging of lung tissue. Dr. Oelze is also studying the use of very high frequency ultrasound for experiments in ultrasound backscatter microscopy. Dr. Oelze has been studying inverse scattering techniques to create tomographic reconstructions of the sound speed, density and attenuation of materials.  Dr. Oelze is researching means to estimate the concentration of ultrasound contrast agents in vivo from the backscattered signals.  Dr. Oelze has developed a novel coded excitation technique combined with pulse compression to double the bandwidth of an ultrasonic imaging system. The additional bandwidth can be used to improve spatial resolution, improve contrast resolution, and/or improve the estimation of scatterer properties. Dr. Oelze is also interested in using coded excitation to improve harmonic imaging in ultrasound. Dr. Oelze is working on a project involving ultrasound-activated microbubbles to enhance cancer therapy. Finally, Dr. Oelze is working on techniques to stage, monitor, and assess high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of solid tumors. The technique is based on using quantitative ultrasound imaging to detect tissue changes due to temperature rise in tissues, and  assessing noninvasively the effects of thermal ablation and hyperthermia on tissues.

jesa,Jose E Schutt-Aine,"The era of big data will lead to systems necessitating the transport of large amounts of information. Today's high-speed I/O signaling links are faced with difficult challenges: pins and interconnects available for off-chip signaling remain almost constant, while the throughput needed is increasing and the required aggregate bandwidths are moving into the Tb/s range (with target bit error rates as low as 10-21 for memory links).  High-speed chip-to-chip communication has historically been considered less critical than the on-chip signaling performance; however, due to today's huge demands for data throughput, off-chip interconnect bandwidth is increasingly becoming the system bottleneck, and creative solutions are needed to meet the requirements, now measured even in terabytes per second  for graphic processing cores. Due to manufacturing and technology limitations, the physical dimension scaling of the passive package and interconnect systems is unable to keep up with the rapid miniaturization benefits enjoyed by active devices (such as silicon chips in CMOS technology nodes) which is dictated by Moore's law. Therefore, the resources (pins and interconnects) available for off-chip signaling remain almost constant, while the throughput needed is increasing. This trend is expected to persist in the future. At the same time, in order to keep up with the data throughput needed over limited resources, high edge rates are being used for signaling. This causes various signal integrity impairments, which in turn limit the system performance and force the data rates to be well below the Shannon limit of the channel capacity. Coupled with the limited channel resources are the conflicting requirements of low power and extremely reliable signaling . All of these limitations combined call for creative solutions in order to keep up with the performance demands of next-generation systems.  In our research group we investigate how these changes will affect the different aspects of high-speed link design. We develop modeling and simulation strategies as well as techniques for mitigating noise while reducing power.","

My main research interests are in understanding fundamental limitations to reliable wireless communication and to leverage this understanding into engineering solutions for wireless networks. An important component of my research is to take a system view of wireless communication by a joint consideration of networking and medium access issues with the underlying time-varying wireless channel. More broadly, I am interested in understanding fundamental limitations to network information transmission and representation. Some of our recent research resolves decades-long open problems in optimal network information compression.

yvlasov,Yurii Vlasov," Dr. Yurii Vlasov is a GEBI Founder Professor of Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is tenured with the departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Bio-Engineering, as well as Carle Illinois College of Medicine. At the UIUC he established the Integrated Neurotechnology lab devoted to development of advanced engineering approaches aimed at reverse engineering of the brain circuits. The major themes include development of silicon-based nanofluidic and nanophotonic neural probes, in-vivo neurobiological experiments with massive recording and manipulation of brain activity, and, lastly, development of machine-learning algorithms to analyze large neural datasets.      Prior to joining the UIUC in 2016, Dr. Vlasov held various research and managerial positions at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in N.Y. where he led broad company-wide efforts in integrated silicon nanophotonics and more recently in neuromorphic computing architectures. He initiated the Silicon Nanophotonics project in 2001 and managed it for over 15 years from its early fundamental research stage up to commercial manufacturing of optical transceivers for large-scale datacenters and supercomputers. The technology has been fully qualified and deployed for commercial production at GlobalFoundries.      Prior to joining IBM in 2001, Dr. Vlasov developed semiconductor nanophotonics at the N.E.C. Research Institute in Princeton, N.J. and at the Strasbourg IPCMS Institute in France. For over a decade, he was also a Research Scientist with the Ioffe Institute of Physics and Technology in St. Petersburg, Russia working on optics of nanostructured semiconductors. He received his M.S. from the University of St. Petersburg (1988) and Ph.D from the Ioffe Institute (1994), both in physics.        Dr. Vlasov is a Fellow of APS, IEEE, and OSA. He has published over 300 papers, filed over 100 patents, and delivered over 100 invited, plenary and tutorial talks.

Dr. Vlasov and his work has been covered in numerous major newspapers, including New York Times, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, and others. It has been featured on television news programs including The Tonight Show, ABC, CBS, etc. It has also been highlighted in review columns on Science Daily, Scientific American Journal, New Scientist, etc. We aim to uncover the basic principles of brain computations that form the basis of perception and guide complex behavior. Our vision is to integrate engineering, systems neuroscience, and data analytics to advance our knowledge of inner working of the brain. Correspondingly, the interdisciplinary projects in the lab can be categorized into three main threads: Neuro-engineering, Neuro-biology, and Neuro-informatics. Neuro-engineering is focused on developing advanced neural probes to interrogate and manipulate the brain using nanotechnology approaches. These novel tools are used in Neuro-biology experiments to record massive datasets of brain activity in live animals during active navigation in virtual reality. Development of machine learning analytical methods in Neuro-informatics thread provides insight into functionality of neural circuits and systems.","

lwaldrop,Lara Waldrop,"Modern societys increasing reliance on space-based assets for communication, navigation, and resource management demands a detailed and precise understanding of the time-varying behavior of the terrestrial atmosphere near low-earth orbit (~200-2000 km). Dr. Waldrop's research addresses this need by devising novel sensing techniques to provide empirical estimation of constituent species temperature and density, quantities which govern the frictional drag of satellites and space debris and thus orbital trajectories and collision hazards. These techniques also support the monitoring and future prediction of transient disturbances caused by space weather, which pose additional dangers to infrastructure through electric charging of satellite electronics, disruption of radio communication signals from space to ground, and induced currents in the electric power grid. Dr. Waldrop's research enables the unprecedented quantification of atmospheric state parameters both directly, via mass spectrometer deployment on small satellites, as well as indirectly, through constraint of numerical models of chemical and radiative processes by various dispersed and often intermittent data sources. The intrinsic challenge of obtaining sufficient model constraints for indirect state parameter estimation demands the utilization of a variety of ground- and space-based remote sensing techniques, including incoherent scatter and frequency-swept radars, and spectroscopy, photometery, and interferometery at wavelengths ranging from near-infrared to far-ultraviolet. The breadth of her research endeavors  from the development and deployment of novel observing modalities, including nano-satellites, to computational model capabilities  enables insights regarding the properties and behavior of the atmospheric boundary region that protects our habitable environment from outer space and sustains our technological infrastructure.","
